# scoring-up
The goal of this project is to build a scoring-up script that takes a finite number of mensural-mei files, each of which only contains one part (voice) from a mensural piece, and merge them into just one mensural-mei file in which all the parts line up. The alignment of the parts is a complex issue, since the same note-shape in mensural notation can have different values (in terms of duration) depending on the context.
